# Students-Guide-to-Special-Functions

This is a collection of material made for students in PHY 201 and PHY 302 at Arizona State University. If you just happen to stumble across this, please feel free
to use it.

Also, if there is anything that needs tweaking or if you want to add any more sections, feel free to do so. We are still figuring out how to credit people for the 
chapters that they write, but when we need to we will figure it out.
